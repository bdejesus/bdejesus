# I'm a Graphic Designer and Frontend Engineer

I'm a web design professional specializing in modern web front-end design and development. I love building beautiful, progressive, and accessible websites and applications.

## A little about me

Officially, I have a degree in _Industrial Design with a concentration on Visual Communication_ (which is a fancy way of saying Graphic Design). I have many, many years of experience as both graphic designer and full-stack engineer, designing, developing, deploying, and scaling web applications.

I'm currently working on a personal open source project called [XIVBARS](https://github.com/bdejesus/xiv-bars). It's a webapp for sharing and importing hotbar keymaps into Final Fantasy XIV (a popular MMORPG). It's a project that I like to work on to play with and learn new technologies.
